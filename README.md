# E-commerce Price Comparison Tool


This project involved developing a dynamic price comparison tool. This innovative tool, powered by a combination of Django and Playwright, streamlines the process of finding the best deals on eBay and Walmart.

The primary goal of this tool is to simplify the shopping experience for users by aggregating search results for specific terms from these leading e-commerce platforms. By utilizing the Playwright headless browser in the backend, the tool efficiently crawls through the websites based on the entered search term, presenting the consolidated results through Django templates on the front end.

The essence of this tool lies in its ability to save customers both time and effort. Instead of hopping between various e-commerce websites to hunt for the best deal, the tool brings the results together in one place. It acts as a time-saving solution, allowing users to make informed decisions without the hassle of navigating multiple sites.
